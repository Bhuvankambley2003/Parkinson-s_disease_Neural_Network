# Parkinson-s_disease_Neural_Network
This project focuses on leveraging neural networks to predict Parkinson's disease by analyzing variations in vocal characteristics. By identifying early signs of the disease through changes in speech patterns, this model aims to aid in early detection, allowing patients to receive timely treatment and adjust their medications more effectively.
